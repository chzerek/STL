There are three directories in the public repository: Dev, Added, and TBA. The information on The directories are as follows:

	-TBA: Stands for To Be Added. Place any future additions in this folder, so that one of us can test and compile a config file. Once an item has been added, please remove it from this folder.

	-Dev: This is the official folder that I (chzerek) will use for packaging and distributing files for the modpack. make sure mod compatibility is tested BEFORE adding a mod to this folder. If it has not been tested yet, please leave it in the TBA directory.

	-Added: Place a copy of anything added to Dev in this directory. That includes any configs to go along with the mods added. When a new version is released, this directory will be cleared.

If there is ANYTHING you are unsure about, contact me (chzerek) before continuing with the action in question. Check this document frequently in case of anything added in the future. Thanks!
